In this project, "A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations" and "Unsupervised Feature Learning via Non-Parametric Instance Discrimination" are implemented. Labeling data is a very challenging process since it is expensive, time-consuming and can make privacy issues. Recently, self-supervised learning has been heavily used to model the representation of the unlabeled data, without any human annotation. The goal of this project is to train the models using a self-supervised learning approach to learn good feature representations with unlabeled data and compare their performance with the models trained in fully supervised learning fashion.
